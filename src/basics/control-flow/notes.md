```Here were going to learn about how to take decisions in our code

    The way we do this is using conditional statements
    for example let's say we want to make a simple game

    Let's say we just wake up and we can decide what we're gonna do and with each decision something happens

    So the way we would go about it in ts is simple like real life

    if (condition goes here) { // do something here }

    So when we make an if statement we say only if the condition we give is true run the code thats in the curly braces and if that condition is evaluated to false then that block of code will not run.
