    ### Understanding Control Flow in TypeScript

    Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program. In TypeScript, control flow allows us to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code based on conditions.

    #### Conditional Statements

    The most common way to control the flow of a program is by using conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

    **Syntax of an `if` statement:**
    ```typescript
    if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if the condition is true
    }
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```typescript
    let isRaining = true;

    if (isRaining) {
      console.log("Take an umbrella!");
    }
    ```

    In this example, the message "Take an umbrella!" will only be logged if the `isRaining` variable is `true`.

    #### Adding `else` and `else if`

    You can extend the `if` statement with `else` and `else if` to handle multiple conditions.

    **Syntax:**
    ```typescript
    if (condition1) {
      // Code to execute if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
      // Code to execute if condition2 is true
    } else {
      // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
    }
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```typescript
    let weather = "sunny";

    if (weather === "rainy") {
      console.log("Take an umbrella!");
    } else if (weather === "cloudy") {
      console.log("It might rain, stay prepared.");
    } else {
      console.log("Enjoy the sunshine!");
    }
    ```

    #### The `switch` Statement

    For scenarios with multiple possible values for a single variable, a `switch` statement can be more concise than multiple `if-else` statements.

    **Syntax:**
    ```typescript
    switch (expression) {
      case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression === value1
        break;
      case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression === value2
        break;
      default:
        // Code to execute if no cases match
    }
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```typescript
    let day = "Monday";

    switch (day) {
      case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the work week!");
        break;
      case "Friday":
        console.log("Almost the weekend!");
        break;
      default:
        console.log("It's just another day.");
    }
    ```

    #### Loops and Control Flow

    Control flow also applies to loops, where you can use `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loops to repeat blocks of code based on conditions.

    **Example of a `for` loop:**
    ```typescript
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
    }
    ```

    **Example of a `while` loop:**
    ```typescript
    let count = 0;

    while (count < 3) {
      console.log(`Count is ${count}`);
      count++;
    }
    ```

    #### Summary

    Control flow is essential for making decisions and repeating actions in your code. By mastering conditional statements and loops, you can write programs that respond dynamically to different inputs and scenarios.
